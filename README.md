# Project MANGA PSIML2017

I use this backpack repo for my software engineering adventures!
Change this readme as needed. Use [Peek](https://github.com/phw/peek) to make gifs for showcase.

# Datasets

Dataset images can be _loaded_ or *patched* from giant montage of all images.

-   `Manga546` -  546 images of color and bw - size 950x640

# Ideas

Every idea is a seperate branch with the same tag

-   `UNET`  -  Train u-net autoencoder on *patched* **Manga546**
